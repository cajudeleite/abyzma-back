# Ticket Email Implementation

This document describes the implementation of automatic ticket email delivery with QR codes after successful ticket creation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. QR Code Generation
- Added `rqrcode` gem for QR code generation
- QR codes contain the ticket UUID for validation
- QR codes are embedded as SVG data URIs in emails

### 2. Email System
- Created `TicketMailer` for sending ticket confirmations
- Beautiful HTML email template with responsive design
- Plain text fallback for email clients that don't support HTML
- Professional styling with ticket details and QR codes

### 3. Automatic Email Delivery
- Modified `TicketCreationService` to automatically send emails after ticket creation
- Email sending is wrapped in error handling to prevent ticket creation failure
- Logs successful email delivery and any errors

### 4. Development Setup
- Added `letter_opener` gem for email preview in development
- Configured development environment to use letter_opener for email delivery
- Emails will open in browser instead of being sent during development

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `app/mailers/ticket_mailer.rb` - Email sending logic
- `app/views/ticket_mailer/ticket_confirmation.html.erb` - HTML email template
- `app/views/ticket_mailer/ticket_confirmation.text.erb` - Text email template

### Modified Files:
- `Gemfile` - Added rqrcode and letter_opener gems
- `app/services/ticket_creation_service.rb` - Added email sending after ticket creation
- `app/mailers/application_mailer.rb` - Updated default from email
- `config/environments/development.rb` - Configured letter_opener for development

## Email Content

Each email includes:
- Personalized greeting with client name
- List of all purchased tickets
- Phase name, ticket ID, and price for each ticket
- QR code for each ticket (embedded as SVG)
- Instructions for using tickets at the venue
- Professional footer with contact information

## QR Code Details

- QR codes contain the ticket UUID
- Generated as SVG format for crisp display
- Embedded as base64 data URIs for email compatibility
- Each QR code is unique to its ticket

## Production Configuration

For production, you'll need to:

1. Configure email delivery method in `config/environments/production.rb`
2. Set up email credentials in Rails credentials or environment variables
3. Configure the `from` email address in `app/mailers/application_mailer.rb`

Example production configuration:
```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  address: 'smtp.your-provider.com',
  port: 587,
  domain: 'yourdomain.com',
  user_name: ENV['SMTP_USERNAME'],
  password: ENV['SMTP_PASSWORD'],
  authentication: 'plain',
  enable_starttls_auto: true
}
```

## Testing

To test the email functionality:

1. Run `bundle install` to install new gems
2. Start the Rails server in development mode
3. Complete a ticket purchase through the normal flow
4. Check your browser - letter_opener will open the email automatically
5. Verify QR codes are generated and displayed correctly

## Error Handling

- Email sending failures are logged but don't prevent ticket creation
- QR code generation errors are handled gracefully
- Invalid ticket data is validated before email sending

## Future Enhancements

- QR code validation endpoint (as mentioned by user)
- Email templates customization
- Bulk email sending for multiple tickets
- Email delivery status tracking
